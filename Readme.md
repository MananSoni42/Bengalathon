# Bengalathon 2019 (Deep Claims)


## Introduction
**Problem Statement:** How can insurers leverage on historical and real-time
data to predict future claims more effectively?

* We created a web-based portal which can be used to effectively access our ML model.
* The customer details can be entered using the 'Add' option and the customer details are saved to our Database.
* The customer is then evaluated by our ML model and is assigned a credibility score and classified as 'Credible' or 'Not Credible'.
* Previous Customers can also be seen and Customer details an be modified using the 'Edit' option.
* The ML model can easily be retrained once new customer data is obtained.

## Machine Learning Model
### Data pre processing
The data can be downloaded from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/xiaomengsun/car-insurance-claim-data/version/1)

The Data obtained had:
* Missing values
* A mix of continuous and categorical features
* Large disparities in the range of features

We tried a variety of techniques to combat these shortcomings:
* Regression to fill in continuous missing values
* Random Forest Classifiers to fill in categorical missing values
* One-hot encoding for the categorical features
* Logarithmic/Adaptive binning to convert the continuous features into categorical features
* Feature Scaling (min-max)
* Auto-encoders to get a small amount of meaningful parameters from the original Dataset
### ML Architecture
We found that an ensemble of ML models outperformed the rest of the models.

</p>
It was observed that some customers were harder to classify than others. Thus, we made a semi-automatic model which passed such hard customers to the experts (Human Intervention). This led to a significant increase in accuracy.
